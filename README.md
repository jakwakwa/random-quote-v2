# random-quote-v2
## Treehouse Tech Degree Project (Unit 1)
by Jaco Kotzee (Jakwakwa)

This is a project I have done for my Treehouse's Tech Degree course on Full Stack Javascript.

In this project I had to create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked.

#### I also made an attempt to get extra credit:
---

* I had to add more properties to the 'quote object'. I included a 'tags' which includes a list of "tags" like "humor", "business", or "politics" to categorize each quote.
* I added javascript code to randomly change the background color of the page when the quote changes, either when clicked, or when quote automatically refreshes (see the below point)
* I added code that refreshes the quote after a set amount of time. (10 seconds) using the 'window.setInterval()' method.
